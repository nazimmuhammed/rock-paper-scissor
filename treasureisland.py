- A door bathed in **Yellow**, faded like time's forgotten sun.

"Three paths await the brave and bold,
But only one holds glittering gold.
One hides flame that dances bright,
Another guards in silent night.
The last, where hunger slept for years,
Holds no teeth, no claws, no fears.

Choose with wit, not strength or brawn,
Lest your tale be dead and gone."

Type 'red', 'blue', or 'yellow' to decide your fate.''')
